## Overview

Blockchain is a costantly growing ledger that keep a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place, in a secure, chronological and immutable way

The bitcoin blockchain is a distributed database that contains a continuously-growing and tamper-evident list of all Bitcoin transactions and records since the date of its initial release in January of 2009.

Whitepaper was published in 2008 October 31

Bitcoin - Peer to Peer electronic cash System

## Components

1) Bitcoin Software

2) Cryptography - new cryptography challenge appx every ten minutes

3) Hardware - Miners race to solve the challenge

4) Gaming Theory

Miner solves the challenge

Rest validates the new block (nonce)

New block is added blockchain - Transactions are written to new block 

Miner is rewarded


## Block

Contains:

- Block Number

- Nonce - Number used once.

- Data

- Hash (SHA256) - has 4 leading/starting zeros - Validates the block is valid or not

- Prev block - Every block is tied together


Every 10 mins a new block gets added to block chain

Genesis Block:
- the first block in a blockchain.

- first transaction was done in 2009 January 3rd

Bitcoin chain DB size - 355 GB

Block Size (Average) - 1 to 2 MB

Transactions per block (Average ) - 1 to 3 K

Total Tranasaction so far - 670 Million

Confirmation time - 5 to minutes

Per block mining rewards - 6.25 bitcoin

## Mine

Mining a block - computer finds the nonce such that the hash starts with 4 starting zeros to make a block valid

## Miners

Miners mine a block by solving a cryptographic problem.

Miners are rewarded for:

- adding a block 

- All transaction fees that were added to that block

- and validating the transaction for consensus ?

Role of miner - build the blockchain. Mine a block and add it to block chain

## Transactions

coinbase transaction - first transaction in a block. Miner receives reward for that block

Peer to Peer transaction

## Features

### Decentralize
bank (freeze ur funds)

Robinhood (stopped trading of stock..)

Each node is running its own block chain software.

Node operators(runs programs) - Individuals

Node - single instance in a decentralize network

Nodes - keeps list of transaction that occur on chain.

### Transparency and flexibility
Everything happening on chain can see
nothing shady
Anonymous

### Speed and efficiency

Bank - takes days to transfer money - remit
Blockchain - settlements are faster, veriried by decentralized nodes..

### Security and Immutability

All nodes cannot go down and compromized

### Removal of counterparty risk

Example: Insurance - may not pay money as per signed contract, may find loop hole

### Trust minimized agreements

math based agreements, contracts are code - yes or no - decisions will be taken by code..

- Hybrid smart contracts 

### Disintermediation

Process of removing intermediatary or middle man.

Transfer of value to another party over internet without any third party (example - bank)


## Key Areas

- Value

- Trust

- Reliability - no single point of failure, distributed



## Digital Token

Digital token is a digital asset (that can be anything).

Example - loyalty points, real world assets, securities


## Smart Contract


## DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

DAC - Decentralized autonomous corporation

- Collection of smart contracts


## Bitcoin Cash

- Block size increased to 8 MB from 1 MB - to improve scalability

- hard fork - change is introduced that forces everyone to upgrade


## Segwet (Segregated Witness)

- Soft fork - change is introduced, backward compatible, dont' need an upgrade

- Improves scalability without improving block size
